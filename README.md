## What does it show?
This piece of code shows you three different charts
* Bar plot
* Bubble plot
* donut chart
Each of them is based on a part of dataset, as I didn't want to jump to the deep, some of the columns are dropped. 
<br>
For instance, for bubble plots, the more calories and carbs a food has, the larger the circle it will appear.
<br>
Additionally, I added a column for food labels that categorizes food based on their calorie content.

## What comes next?
I'm gonna use linear regression to predict food's calories.
